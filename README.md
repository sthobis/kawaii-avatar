# Kawaii-Avatar

## What is this?
Kawaii Avatar is a deterministic user avatar generator for your projects.  
The same url will always produce the same image which means you can provide consistent avatar for your users.  
Illustrations are provided by [react-kawaii](https://react-kawaii.now.sh).

## Why?
Because most default avatar on the web is not k-kawaii enough?

## How to use it?
You can inline Kawaii Avatar url on your user avatar image source
```html
<img src="https://kawaii-avatar.now.sh/avatar?username=sthobis" alt="sthobis's avatar" />
```
